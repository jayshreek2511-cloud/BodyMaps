    # (built from request.url_root) comes out http:// and fails to match what's
    # registered with Google/GitHub, and request.remote_addr is the proxy — so
    # every visitor geolocates to the server itself and the whole site shares
    # one rate-limit bucket. Opt-in because these headers are client-spoofable
    # when nothing trusted is in front of the app.
    #
    # TRUST_PROXY_HOPS is how many proxies are in front of the app, and it must
    # match the deployment exactly. ProxyFix counts from the RIGHT of
    # X-Forwarded-For, so the value is "how many entries at the end of that
    # header were written by infrastructure I control".
    #
    # Too low and you read a proxy's own address instead of the visitor's. Too
    # high and you read whatever the client put there — anyone can send an
    # X-Forwarded-For header, so an over-count is a spoofing hole, which is why
    # this defaults to 1 rather than to something permissive.
    #
    # bodymaps.wse.jhu.edu sits behind two: a campus edge proxy and nginx, so it
    # sets 2. Check yours rather than guessing — restart gunicorn with
    #   --access-logformat "XFF=[%({X-Forwarded-For}i)s]"
    # and count the entries on a request from OUTSIDE the network. Traffic from
    # inside is NAT'd and shows a private address where the visitor's should be,
